seconds to appear.

The maximum results per page is 100.

end_time = 'end_time2'
sort_order = 'sort_order0'
cursor = 'cursor6'
location_id = 'location_id4'

# Create Payment

Creates a payment using the provided source. You can use this endpoint
to charge a card (credit/debit card or  
Square gift card) or record a payment that the seller received outside of Square
(cash payment from a buyer or a payment that an external entity
processed on behalf of the seller).

The endpoint creates a
`Payment` object and returns it in the response.

```python
def create_payment(self,
                  body)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |

# Cancel Payment by Idempotency Key

Cancels (voids) a payment identified by the idempotency key that is specified in the
request.

Use this method when the status of a `CreatePayment` request is unknown (for example, after you send a
`CreatePayment` request, a network error occurs and you do not get a response). In this case, you can
direct Square to cancel the payment using this endpoint. In the request, you provide the same
idempotency key that you provided in your `CreatePayment` request that you want to cancel. After
canceling the payment, you can submit your `CreatePayment` request again.

Note that if no payment with the specified idempotency key is found, no action is taken and the endpoint
returns successfully.

```python
def cancel_payment_by_idempotency_key(self,
                                     body)
```
