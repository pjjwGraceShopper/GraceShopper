Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed<br>with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.<br><br>Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.<br><br>An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.<br><br>Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same<br>application.<br><br>For more information, see [Metadata](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/metadata). |
